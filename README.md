# [Project 6 - Node Calculator](https://github.com/mikesz88/nodeCalcFinal)

You are going to create a terminal-based calculator program using Node.

## Tech Used:

## Requirements: 
1. Ask the user, "What operation would you like to perform?"

2. Then the user enters one of these options: "/" "*" "-" "+"

3. If the user enters an invalid character print, "That is not a valid operation" and then restart the program

4. After the user enters a valid operation, ask the user, "Please enter the first number"

5. The user then enters any group of numbers. If the user enters something that is not a number, print "This is not a number" and then re-ask the question

6. After a valid number is entered, ask the user, "Please enter the second number". Perform the same error handling as before

7. Then perform the proper math operation and print the result as, "The result is: X" where is is the actual result

8. I'd recommend using the [readline-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync) npm package for this project.

9. Handle remainders properly (modulo). Example : 9 divided by 4 would print 2.25
10. Make the program more elegant by allowing the user to enter an entire operation on one line such as: "6 / 6" or "5 * 3" (Hint use arguments to solve this)
