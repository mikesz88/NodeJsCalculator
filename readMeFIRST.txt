I have two files attached to this. The nodeCalc.js file and optionalNodeCalc.js file are the ones I did just now in our academy. I did not look back whatsoever on the other one. 
The other folder '30DayChallengeNodeCalc' is the one I made during the 30 day challenge. 

I am not asking to grade both of them (that be nice!!!) but more compare what I did then to what I am doing now. 
Such as what are the preferred strategies, what could I have done more efficient, etc...

If this is too much a burden and you have to only look at one, then I completely understand why. 

Thanks again for your assistance and hope you are doing well!
